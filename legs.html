                <p id="text">Leg Day, the most dreaded day of all. Here we will begin the workout with heavy <strong>Barbell Squats</strong>, a perfect full body excercise where we will
                primarily target your quads and hamstrings. Depth is a big aspect of this list, to perform a propper squat you must squat low enough where your thighs are parallel to the 
            floor. Next we will isolate our hamstrings using the <strong>Hamstrings Machine</strong> stretching and contracting on each rep. Another isometric excercise is the 
        <strong>Leg Extension Machine</strong> where the quads are the main focus of the lift, meant to shape and tone the quads. To end the workout we will do a series of 
        <strong>Calf Raises</strong> to help make your legs more proportional. </p>
