                <p id="text">I'm a strong believer in <strong>Pull Ups</strong>, a great excercise meant to warm the upper body up. Just want you 
                to 3 reps where you feel the contractions in your back. Next is my favorite lift, <strong>Dumbell Bench Press</strong>. Here 
            you have to retract your shoulder blades and angle your arms at a 45 degree angle. We want to go <strong>HEAVY</strong>, 
        and progressively increase the weight we push. Thirdly we will target our sholders with <strong>Lateral Raises</strong>, built shoulders
    make you appear more built. Lastly we'll finish off our push day with <strong>Cable Chest Flys</strong> to really sqeeze our chest and 
pump as much blood into the area.</p>
