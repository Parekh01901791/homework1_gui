                <p id="text">Starting off with <strong>Pull Ups</strong>, it's a great full body excercise to warm up your back and core. Second is the <strong>Lat Pull Down</strong> a 
                great lift targeting the latissimus dorsi, the largest muscle in the back, as well as your biceps, rear delts, rhomboids and traps. <strong>Rows</strong>, target the 
            lats, rear delts, lower traps, rhomboids, and spinal erectors. Because of the high number of muscles being targeted, it's best practice to go heavy to spread the load across
        all helping muscles. Next up is <strong>Machine Curls</strong>, an exercise targeting the bicep that needs to be perfomed slow and controlled, squeezing on every rep. Lastly we'll 
    end the workout off with <strong>Standing Cable Curls</strong>, going extremely light to feel every rep.</p>
